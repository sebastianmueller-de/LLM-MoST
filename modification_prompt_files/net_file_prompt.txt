The change will be implemented via the manipulation of the SUMO route file containing the specified routes of all vehicles contained in the driving scenario. To aid you in manipulating the behavior in the next step, you will first be supplied with the corresponding .net file. This file contains information on the road network in the SUMO file format. Keep in mind the IDs of the lanes and focus on the connections between them. This is important, since it will limit the allowed modifications for the next step. Return a summary of your analysis, containing the relevant information of the edges, their connections, and the involved IDs. Generally speaking, the more details you include regarding the layout, the better. You will not implement the user's request in this step. Instead, you will summarize possible routes of the net file, analyze the relationships between the edges and connections, and return your analysis in the output. In the next step, you will be asked to concretely implement the change. You will never modify the .net file or change the road network. You will only ever modify vehicle behavior, vehicle trajectories, or vehicle presence in the scenario.
To help your understanding of the SUMO .net.xml file, here is a short example explaining the most important sections:

<edge id=":17_1" function="internal">
    <lane id=":17_1_0" index="0" disallow="pedestrian tram rail_urban rail rail_electric ship" speed="7.08" length="10.46" width="3.50" shape="5.52,-10.00 5.78,-9.48 6.82,-8.11 7.70,-7.38 8.72,-6.85 9.82,-6.55 11.54,-6.49 13.23,-6.78 14.46,-7.16"/>
</edge>
Explanation: An internal edge, as recognized by the function="internal" field. Used by SUMO for calculations and logical, internal connections. Users should typically not mention this field and you can ignore it for the most part.

<edge id="2261" from="10" to="18" priority="3" type="highway.residential" spreadType="center" length="10.64" shape="-24.20,7.45 -10.47,2.27">

</edge>
Explanation: A simple edge consisting of a single lane. The ID that we should keep in mind is the edge id (2261), not the lane id, since the manipulation will be based on the edge-level. It is also important to note that the associated lane disallows many types of vehicles. For example: Since "tram" is explicitly disallowed, we would not let the user place a tram on this edge or specify the trajectory of a tram to lead to this edge.

<edge id="2042" from="18" to="15" priority="3" type="highway.residential" spreadType="center" length="81.35">
    <lane id="2042_0" index="0" disallow="pedestrian tram rail_urban rail rail_electric ship" speed="36.11" length="81.35" width="3.50" customShape="1" shape="-10.80,-3.85 -25.58,-42.06 -40.15,-79.72"/>
    <lane id="2042_1" index="1" disallow="pedestrian tram rail_urban rail rail_electric ship" speed="36.11" length="81.35" width="3.50" customShape="1" shape="-7.54,-5.11 -22.32,-43.32 -36.88,-80.99"/>
</edge>
Explanation: This is a more complex edge containing two different lanes. However, the interesting part for us is the edge id (2042) again, which we will use for identifying this part of the road network.

<connection from="2261" to="2042" fromLane="0" toLane="0" keepClear="0" contPos="-4.00" shape="-14.28,3.61 -12.75,2.84 -11.84,2.14 -11.09,1.26 -10.60,0.23 -10.38,-0.90 -10.41,-2.04 -10.78,-3.72 -11.02,-4.41" via=":18_3_0" tl="18" linkIndex="1" dir="r" state="o"/>
Explanation: This details a direct connection from one edge to another, meaning it is a valid path for vehicles that are allowed on both of the edges. "from" specifies the starting edge, whereas "to" specifies the end point of this connection. Note that these connections are one-directional.

<connection from="21892" to="24807" fromLane="0" toLane="0" keepClear="0" contPos="-4.00" shape="-259.97,-206.76 -254.29,-205.09 -248.60,-203.42" via=":28_6_0" dir="s" state="m"/>
<connection from="24807" to="21962" fromLane="0" toLane="0" keepClear="0" contPos="-4.00" via=":12_0_0" dir="s" state="M"/>
Explanation: Here you can see a transitive series of connections. Edge 21892 connects to edge 24807, which then connects to 21962. This is important - it means that a user could specify a trajectory from 21892 to 21962, and it is your task to recognize that this is indeed valid (due to the edge in-between connecting the two other edges).

Here is an example:

Output:
**Overall Road Network Structure:**
The network appears to be centered around a main junction, identified by `junction id="13"`. This junction serves as a hub connecting several incoming and outgoing edges. The junction type is "zipper," indicating a merging or diverging point.
**Key Edges and Their Connections:**
*   **Edge `1`**:
    *   Starts at junction `1` (a dead end) and ends at junction `13`.
    *   It has one lane: `1_0`.
    *   This edge represents an approach to the central junction `13`.
*   **Edge `2`**:
    *   Starts at junction `13` and ends at junction `4` (a dead end).
    *   It has one lane: `2_0`.
    *   This edge represents an exit from the central junction `13`.
*   **Edge `506`**:
    *   Starts at junction `10` (a dead end) and ends at junction `13`.
    *   It has one lane: `506_0`.
    *   This edge also represents an approach to the central junction `13`.
*   **Edge `507`**:
    *   Starts at junction `13` and ends at junction `11` (a dead end).
    *   It has one lane: `507_0`.
    *   This edge represents an exit from the central junction `13`.
    *   This is the edge the user wants the vehicle to move to. I should keep this in mind.
*   **Edge `57`**:
    *   Starts at junction `13` and ends at junction `12` (a dead end).
    *   It has one lane: `57_0`.
    *   This edge represents an exit from the central junction `13`.
*   **Edge `58`**:
    *   Starts at junction `5` (a dead end) and ends at junction `13`.
    *   It has one lane: `58_0`.
    *   This edge represents an approach to the central junction `13`.
**Connections at Junction `13`:**
The `connection` elements detail how vehicles can move between edges, primarily through the internal lanes associated with junction `13`.
*   **From `1` to `57`**: A connection exists from edge `1` (lane `1_0`) to edge `57` (lane `57_0`) via internal lane `:13_4_0`. This is a right turn (`dir="r"`).
*   **From `1` to `507`**: A connection exists from edge `1` (lane `1_0`) to edge `507` (lane `507_0`) via internal lane `:13_5_0`. This is a left turn (`dir="l"`).
*   **From `506` to `2`**: A connection exists from edge `506` (lane `506_0`) to edge `2` (lane `2_0`) via internal lane `:13_0_0`. This is a right turn (`dir="r"`).
*   **From `506` to `57`**: A connection exists from edge `506` (lane `506_0`) to edge `57` (lane `57_0`) via internal lane `:13_1_0`. This is a left turn (`dir="l"`).
*   **From `58` to `507`**: A connection exists from edge `58` (lane `58_0`) to edge `507` (lane `507_0`) via internal lane `:13_2_0`. This is a right turn (`dir="r"`).
*   **From `58` to `2`**: A connection exists from edge `58` (lane `58_0`) to edge `2` (lane `2_0`) via internal lane `:13_3_0`. This is a left turn (`dir="l"`).
**Summary of Possible Routes:**
Based on the connections, vehicles can travel as follows:

    *   From edge `1` (junction `1`) to junction `13`.
    *   From edge `506` (junction `10`) to junction `13`.
    *   From edge `58` (junction `5`) to junction `13`.
*   **Exiting Junction 13:**
    *   From junction `13` to edge `2` (leading to junction `4`).
    *   From junction `13` to edge `507` (leading to junction `11`).
    *   From junction `13` to edge `57` (leading to junction `12`).
**Specific Route Possibilities:**
*   **From edge `1`:** Can go straight to edge `57` (right turn at junction 13) or turn left to edge `507`.
*   **From edge `506`:** Can go straight to edge `2` (right turn at junction 13) or turn left to edge `57`.
*   **From edge `58`:** Can go straight to edge `507` (right turn at junction 13) or turn left to edge `2`.

Here is the complete .net.xml file specific to the scenario in question. Do not provide your reworked route file just yet - you will be provided with the version you need to update shortly. If the user has already provided you with the IDs of certain edges, focus on the edges and connections mentioning them:
