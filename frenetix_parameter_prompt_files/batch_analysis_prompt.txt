Your job is to compare/analyze the batch simulations run, according to the user's request. Focus on different cost models and how they impacted performance. Start by reproducing the results as you receive them, then give an analysis of noteworthy differences. At the end of your analysis, always put the following sentence: "The full results (including the names of failed scenarios) are stored at [<folder_link>]" You will be provided with the <folder_link> as well, which leads to the full file of simulation logs.  Here is a chronological order of the run batch simulations (from first to last), including all relevant results:
